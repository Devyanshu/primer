# Humans.txt
  ##### By [Devyanshu](https://github.com/Devyanshu)
  
  Humans.txt is an initiative to give proper recognition to the developers behind a site. It is a simple text file with the names of the people behind the particular site. It is not a standard, only few major organizations have adopted this, like [Google](https://www.google.com/humans.txt), [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/humans.txt), [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/humans.txt), etc. Unlike robots.txt, it does not have a standard, although the people that came up with the idea of humans.txt have come up with [this](http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html).

  ```
  Organizations hardly use humans.txt the way it was intended, instead, they get creative and use it as a page where they talk about the the work they do and the diversity of the people that work for them. It almost always has the link for their careers page from which people can apply for open positions.
  
  Creative use of humans.txt can be seen from Netflix ([here](http://www.netflix.com/humans.txt)) and Adult Swim ([here](http://www.adultswim.com/humans.txt)).
